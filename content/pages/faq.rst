How does Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) help?
---------------------------------------

Bring the power of a free Digital Library of Alexandria into the hands
of any school worldwide! Internet-in-a-Box is also used in medical
clinics and libraries. Might you want to \ `create your own
Internet-in-a-Box? <https://opensource.com/article/17/5/internet-in-a-box-raspberry-pi>`__\

`2 <http://people.sugarlabs.org/~icarito/newsletter_sugarlabs/ProofSLNewsP5.psf.pdf_2>`__

If so, read about the original
`Internet-in-a-Box <http://internet-in-a-box.org>`__ (rich open content
often included with `IIAB <http://xsce.org>`__) to build up your
community's very own 21st century digital library
`below. <#What_can_I_do_with_E-books_and_Internet-in-a-Box.3F>`__

An Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) server brings your classroom/school laptops
together, `communicating & coordinating learning <../#Our_Product>`__ in
ways that deeply empower `kids, teachers and
community <http://planet.laptop.org>`__.

IIAB is built by professional volunteers, inspired by `One Laptop per
Child's <http://one.laptop.org>`__ famous laptops and their innovative
`Sugar Learning Platform <http://sugarlabs.org>`__ -- but with a `wider
vision <XS_Community_Edition/Vision>`__ of serving all!

Where is Internet-in-a-Box used?
--------------------------------

Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) was originally called the OLPC School Server
Community Edition (XSCE) and is in use in more than a dozen countries,
from smaller communities to large-scale deployments.

Examples include several
`orphanages <http://schoolserver.wordpress.com/2013/03/29/my-first-school-server-deployment/>`__
and schools in `Haiti <http://olpcMAP.net>`__ to a youth community in
`Malaysia <http://olpcbasecamp.blogspot.com/>`__, to villages in
`Northern India <http://bhagmalpur.wordpress.com>`__, to a girls science
school in `Rwanda <http://www.rwandagirlsinitiative.org/ggast/>`__, to
rural communities and libraries across southwest
`Ghana <http://ghanatogether.blogspot.com/>`__ -- and more broad
`Central American deployments <https://github.com/germanrs/xsce>`__ like
`Nicaragua <http://fundacionzt.org/>`__, Costa Rica and 6 schools in the
Dominican Republic beginning late 2015.

Libraries and rural medical clinics are also avid users of IIAB.

Many `contributors <https://groups.google.com/group/unleashkids>`__ are
also using IIAB for more personal/grassroots purposes as well, helping
refine our community product for diverse/larger impacts.

What can I do with E-books and Internet-in-a-Box?
-------------------------------------------------

Many quality gems are downloadable to your Internet-in-a-Box server. If
however downloading is not feasible, sharing or purchasing a hard-drive
packed full of incredible Wikipedia + Maps + Literature + Khan Academy
learning resources is possible. Contact http://unleashkids.org
volunteers should this be necessary.

If downloading is possible with a very fast Internet connection, follow
the `"Add Content"
instructions <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#add-content>`__.

Either way, entirely new opportunities are opening up for semi-connected
schools and offline libraries worldwide, for the 1st time ever. Medical
clinics and museums are also taking advantage in 2017, with prisons
seriously considering Internet-in-a-Box too.

We'd like educators' suggestions especially -- how should kids best take
advantage of these crown jewels of learning? Perhaps starting with
OLPC/Sugar's laptop browser in places like:

In the future, we hope the
`Pathagar <https://github.com/PathagarBooks>`__ `"E-book
library" <http://www.olpcsf.org/node/126>`__ will begin to work much
better with IIAB/XSCE!

| See: `Can teachers display their own
  content? <#Can_teachers_display_their_own_content.3F>`__
| See: `How do I customize my school server's start
  page? <#How_do_I_customize_my_school_server.27s_start_page.3F>`__
| See: `What are the default
  passwords? <#What_are_the_default_passwords?>`__

Can teachers display their own content?
---------------------------------------

Yes, teachers can spontaneously insert (and remove!) their own USB
memory sticks and USB drives anytime. Somewhat like an informal
projector, the teacher's content appears to students almost instantly
at:

+--------------------+
|http://box/usb      |
|                    |
+--------------------+

Instructions:

#. **In advance, the teacher must create a folder called "usb" on their
   USB memory stick, placing audio/video materials, handouts, challenges
   or presentation(s) inside that folder.**
#. Then the teacher inserts their USB stick/drive into any one of the
   server's USB ports.
#. Done! The "teacher content" is available (live) to students within
   seconds. WARNING: Older browsers and non-standard phones/devices
   cannot access http://box/usb, and so require that students type in
   http://box.lan/usb or http://172.18.96.1/usb


Note it's OK to insert multiple USB sticks/drives at the same time. If
so, content from each USB stick/drive is visible within http://box/usb,
e.g. in sub-folders that will be obvious, like the following:

::


  http://box/usb/USB0
  http://box/usb/USB1

More details in the `Install
Doc <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#external-usbdrive-content>`__.
Finally, if you have a screen attached to your server, and occasionally
see an old error as follows, it is safe to ignore it:

::


  Unable to mount 2.0 GB Volume
  Device /dev/sdb1 us already mounted at '/media/usb0'.

See: `How do I customize my school server's start
page? <#How_do_I_customize_my_school_server.27s_start_page.3F>`__


What hardware should I use?
---------------------------

Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) is free and open source software that runs on
many different hardware
`platforms <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Platforms>`__:

-  **Raspberry Pi 3 ($35 + parts) and the Raspberry Pi Zero W ($10 +
   parts):** It continues to astonish us how powerful these 2 tiny "RPi"
   computers really are, able to serve 32 students simultaneously, with
   their powerful built-in Wi-Fi. We strongly recommend the RPi 3, for
   DIY implementers building their 1st digital library to serve a
   classroom. For smaller kiosk scenarios serving just a few people
   (Internet-in-a-Box is used in rural medical clinics and similar)
   definitely consider the RPi Zero W.

-  **Refurbished "Windows" Laptops:** Quality donated laptops can
   sometimes work extremely well to install Internet-in-a-Box,
   ironically acting as a server for an entire developing world
   classroom or small school. However an external Wi-Fi router is
   usually required, making installation more complex than RPi and Mini
   PCs (whose internal Wi-Fi is generally capable of AP mode, so an
   external Wi-Fi router is not required in many/most classrooms!)
   Still, the spaghetti wiring of an external router may be worth it, if
   the laptop has a reasonably new battery, acting as a de facto
   `UPS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply>`__
   (critically important in developing world schools where electricity
   comes and goes). Of course quality used laptops with large hard disks
   and multiple GB of memory are better yet. *Finally: make sure the
   laptop runs Linux well, and has a BIOS that permits it to run while
   the screen is closed.*

-  **Intel NUC:** Avoid classic/desktop PCs whenever possible, as they
   consume far too much electricity. However tough, well-rounded,
   low-power Mini PCs (such as the Intel NUC) world extremely well, have
   proven very effective as school servers in the developing world since
   2014. We typically insist on NUC models that accept SATA (2.5 inch
   hard drives, HDD or SSD) and work with DC voltages up to 19V.
   Warning: low-end NUC models only work right near 12V, and so are not
   reliable using lead-acid batteries that you find in most solar
   installations. Finally: the NUC is not a fan-less device, but
   nevertheless has proved very reliable across diverse climates.

-  **Other Mini PC competitors:**
   `MSI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-Star_International>`__
   units have proven very solid, and Zotac perhaps less so. Definitely
   consider `Gigabyte BRIX <http://www.gigabyte.us/Mini-PcBarebone>`__
   (e.g. GB-BSI3H-6100) which is almost an exact clone of the NUC. As a
   bonus, the BRIX allows internal Wi-Fi to scale beyond the Intel NUC's
   annoying limitation of 12 connections maximum. To make this happen,
   insert an appropriate Atheros Wi-Fi module (typically < $10) into the
   BRIX. `George
   Hunt <https://schoolserver.wordpress.com/author/georgejhunt/>`__ can
   answer questions around which Atheros Wi-Fi modules have been tested
   to work, as of February 2017. *Recap: scaling up internal Wi-Fi is
   sadly not possible with Intel NUCs since 2015 (5th generation NUCs
   and onwards) as Intel's Wi-Fi module is unfortunately soldered in.*

-  **ARM Mini PCs:** CPUs like `TrimSlice /
   Utilite <http://trimslice.com>`__ and `Cubox by
   SolidRun <http://solid-run.com>`__ might one day catch up, providing
   much-needed community momentum and packaging. To date however we have
   been disappointed with their firmware, and the availability of Linux
   kernels/drivers working with internal SATA / internal Wi-Fi (e.g. AP
   mode), *to truly make teachers' lives easier*. But check back as many
   more global deployments' experiences accumulate, and rugged low-end
   hardware increasingly emerges, on OrangePi or similar?

-  **One Laptop Per Child:** We do NOT recommend the original XO-1
   laptop as a server (256MB RAM is insufficient). However several have
   successfully deployed the very rugged XO-1.5, XO-1.75 (ARM) and XO-4
   (ARM) as school servers in Haiti and Malaysia etc. Thanks to George
   Hunt's amazing work here over the years.

MEMORY: Some do fine with 512MB RAM (even in 2017!) serving static
content from the RPi Zero W. Others do just fine serving dozens of
simultaneous video streams from an RPi3 with 1GB RAM. Finally, certain
others require 8GB or more within a Mini PC, when server-side loads
become intensive. For example if you are running an
`LMS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system>`__,
experiencing a lot of OpenStreetMap traffic, or when fileserver-like
capabilities are mandated for all students.

STORAGE: While there's increasing movement from hard disks to SSDs and
MicroSDs every year, many others still swear by tried-and-true hard
drives. Certainly rotating media are the clear winner when
large-capacities are needed at a low price. In the end all storage
technologies can fail, each in there own ways. So it's far more more
important to start with the actual community's learning goals, engaging
educators around their authentic content/interaction needs — and then
narrow in on storage capacity/technologies later. Alternative: consider
this earlier discussion of `external USB hard disks and their possible
risks <http://lists.laptop.org/pipermail/server-devel/2013-June/thread.html#6490>`__.

*HEAT/DIRT/DUST: Ensure your server is positioned with ample room around
it for ventilation, away from direct sunlight. Dirt/dust will collect
inside it almost regardless, and should certainly be removed from time
to time.*

Thank you for asking further hardware questions at http://iiab.io !

What OS should I use?
---------------------

Our latest OS (Linux distribution) recommendations should always be
posted within the `IIAB
Platforms <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Platforms>`__
document. **Generally Raspbian on Raspberry Pi 3 is best for people
getting their feet wet in 2017,** regardless whether they prefer the
full/graphical Raspbian Pixel (includes many amazing desktop apps for
learning, on LXDE-pi) or Raspbian Lite (does not include X Windows) for
a more classic/headless server.

Others like Reno McKenzie & Josh Dennis are experimenting successfully
(some tweaks required!) with IIAB on the lean & mean http://DietPi.com
in February/March 2017.

In recent years,
Security/Maintenance/\ `TCO <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost_of_ownership>`__
concerns have caused deployments to step back from the (bleeding) edge,
preferring
`LTS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support>`__\ (\*)
multi-year support updates that accompany stable OS's like `CentOS
7 <http://seven.centos.org/>`__ (`security updates until 30 June
2024 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS#End-of-support_schedule>`__),
`Debian GNU/Linux <https://www.debian.org/News/>`__ — **or increasingly
`Ubuntu LTS (64-bit 16.04) <http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/>`__ which
is newly supported as of `IIAB 6.3 <../6.3>`__.**

(\*) Many schools/libraries/clinics now believe LTS is necessary to
avoid the rapid annual turnover of Fedora (inherited from OLPC in 2012,
during the transition from XS to XSCE). Whereas `in the
past <XS_Community_Edition/6.0#Supported_OS.27s>`__, deployments often
preferred the cutting-edge features provided by a recent version of the
`Fedora
OS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_%28operating_system%29>`__,
similar to `OLPC OS 13.2.8 <13.2.8>`__.

Finally, if there are situations where porting to a new OS/distro will
tangibly help schools/libraries/clinics across an entire region, don't
hesitate to reach out (on our
`server-devel <http://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/server-devel>`__ mailing
list, on our http://iiab.io forums or contact holt @ laptop.org) as you
assess the scope-of-work to complete such a job.

Is a quick installation possible?
---------------------------------

Verify that your `hardware <#What_hardware_should_I_use.3F>`__ and
`Linux OS <#What_OS_should_I_use.3F>`__ are appropriate! Visual
shortcuts to some of the more common installs can then be found at the
top-right of http://schoolserver.org = http://wiki.iiab.io (please see
http://download.iiab.io and the **`Install
Doc <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation>`__** for
more!)

To install `Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) 6.3 <../6.3>`__ onto
`Raspbian <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/>`__ on a $35
Raspberry Pi 3 computer, run our 1-line installer:

::

  curl http://download.iiab.io/6.3/rpi/load-lite.txt | sudo bash

This takes about an hour if you have a fast connection and modern
microSD card. *An Ethernet (live Internet) cable installed into the back
of your Raspberry Pi 3 is very strongly recommended during
installation!*

If you want the Very Latest (master branch of IIAB 6.4) and are happy to
face pre-release issues (`we'll actively support you if so, get in
touch! <#What_are_the_best_places_for_community_support.3F>`__) then
give this a shot instead:

::

  curl http://download.iiab.io/6.4/rpi/load-lite.txt | sudo bash

In either above case, use "load.txt" instead of "load-lite.txt" if you
want a more complete install (with more server apps!) noting this can
take substantially more than an hour.

On classical PC hardware, follow the **`"Do Everything from
Scratch" <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#do-everything-from-scratch>`__**
instructions. `MBR <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record>`__
was preferred in the past, but
`UEFI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface>`__
can work (as set in your PC/server's BIOS) if your `Linux
distribution <#What_OS_should_I_use.3F>`__ supports that. Beware that
`partitioning is
critical <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Platforms#disk-partitioning>`__
particularly with distros like CentOS that attempt to allocate all
extra/surplus space to ``/home`` by default (this won't work, as the
most voluminous content will be placed in ``/library`` instead!)
Finally, avoid enabling LVM partitioning, especially if you'll later be
needing Clonezilla to duplicate the disk.

Then, to get down to real business (education!) there are a variety of
ways to `**add
content** <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#add-content>`__
to your Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) server.

After installation, please explore learning materials within your
server's home page (http://box or http://box.lan) and also get to know
the Admin Console (http://box/admin or http://box.lan/admin) which
permits you to (1) configure your school server and (2) download new
content. Example screenshots: (stale graphics from 2015, but that's the
idea!)

-  `Main Menu <http://ibin.co/2BDiyiJ9rAxS>`__
-  `Install Kiwix ZIM Files <http://ibin.co/2BDjTw3m4xB1>`__
-  `Select Languages <http://ibin.co/2BDjfne5Yx0h>`__
-  `Select All Languages <http://ibin.co/2BDjumo44V31>`__
-  `Display Job Status <http://ibin.co/2BDkGKTWvR0K>`__

Finally, to arrange an elegant portal/home page (typically http://box)
for all your students or users to explore, we recommend you organize
your chosen Content Packs using the `Dynamic
Menuing <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Menuing>`__ system. As
explained `just
below <#How_do_I_customize_my_server.27s_home_page.3F>`__, this allows
you to rapidly prototype and iterate your portal/home page's
presentation, tailoring it to your community/library or clinic's precise
needs.

Legacy Install Techniques, many of which are deprecated as they long

How do I customize my server's home page?
-----------------------------------------

Starting April 2017, our install images often include sample content to
more quickly springboard implementers into content curation, as outlined
within `Guidelines for Creating IIAB Images incl Sample Content
Packs <http://tinyurl.com/iiabimages>`__.

If you want to showcase your school or community logo/colors on the main
portal/start page (what people see at http://box or http://box.lan), you
can customize /library/www/html/home/index.html , where most standard
HTML tags should work. Please create a backup copy of your ongoing
index.html beautifications regularly!

Starting with IIAB/XSCE 6.1 and 6.2 especially, *Dynamic Menuing* is an
alternative approach for those wanting far less hand-coding, that (as a
bonus) auto-adjusts all
`http://SERVERNAMES:PORTS <http://SERVERNAMES:PORTS>`__ live using
browser-side Javascript, for maximum deployment flexibility. To enable
this on your server, please read about *Menu Definitions* and *HTML
Fragments* within this page:
https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Menuing

Likewise as many educators want quick customizations on their
portal/menuing beyond the logo, some may consider experimental WYSIWYG
tools like DokuWiki, WordPress, or Moodle. For example you might lay out
your content in an indigenous language, linking to content gems truly
relevant to locals. To try these approaches, visit your server's Admin
Console at http://box/admin -> Configure tab -> Server Portal -> Select
Server Home Page. As of IIAB/XSCE 6.2, your choices include:

-  /home
-  /wordpress
-  /wiki

Enable WordPress or DokuWiki correspondingly, at the top of that page.
Then click "Save Configuration", click "Install Configured Options" then
monitor the result (typically takes 15-25min on a Raspberry Pi 3) under
"Utilities" tab -> "Display Job Status".

If you need further customization suggestions and tips, don't hesitate
to post to our http://iiab.io forums and/or write to:
https://groups.google.com/group/unleashkids !

What are the default passwords?
-------------------------------

For `KA Lite, ownCloud, Moodle, Elgg, DokuWiki,
etc <#What_can_I_do_with_E-books_and_Internet-in-a-Box.3F>`__ the
administrative user is **Admin** (don't forget the capital A) and the
default/initial password is: **changeme**

For the Admin Console(\*) at http://box/admin, http://box.lan/admin or
http://172.18.96.1/admin, the username is **iiab-admin** and the
default/initial password is: **g0adm1n** (note the numbers 0, 1)

Change iiab-admin's password before connecting your server to the
Internet. You can do this within http://box/admin -> Utilities menu — or
at the command line, if you type "passwd iiab-admin".

If your OS is Raspbian Pixel: also change the password for user "pi"
from "raspberry" before connecting to the Internet. At the command line,
type "passwd pi". Starting with `IIAB/XSCE 6.2's standardized
images <http://tinyurl.com/iiabimages>`__ (beginning April 2017) we
removed the passwords for user "root" (and where possible for user "pi"
too, within headless images), by setting their `password fields to \*
(the asterisk
character) <http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/252016/difference-between-vs-vs-in-etc-shadow>`__
within /etc/shadow. This prevents direct ssh access to such accounts.

Still, both users "iiab-admin" and "pi" (if they exist) have root
(sudoer) powers. As such, advanced operators generally log in as
iiab-admin and then escalate to root using "sudo su -".

*(\*) While the Admin Console can change iiab-admin's password
instantly, it's important to understand that many Admin Console changes
(within its Configure menu especially) require you click "Save
Configuration" then "Install Configured Options" and then wait for this
to complete. Monitor for Status "SUCCEEDED" under Utilities menu ->
Display Job Status (takes 20-25 min on a Raspberry Pi 3!)*

Finally, certain install-time passwords are listed in
`local\_vars.yml <../local_vars.yml>`__ which overrides passwords listed
in
`default\_vars.yml <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Architecture#detailed-description-of-ansible-control-variables>`__.
If you must change any of these install-time passwords (by modifying
local\_vars.yml) don't forget to then run "Install Configured Options"
above!

Warning: KA Lite's **Admin** password cannot be changed in a browser, so
you need to run "kalite manage changepassword Admin" (http://box:8008
can only change KA Lite's user passwords). Help is available if you type
"kalite manage help changepassword".

How do I provide Solar Power to my school, library or orphanage?
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very hard question depending on the growth path of your
electrical needs, maintenance options within the country in question,
price, theft, etc. Some `experienced deployment
voices <http://www.unleashkids.org/2014/02/21/off-the-grid-suitcase-solar-solutions-for-power-in-haiti/>`__
provide concrete examples, typically involving a standard 12-volt
`deep-cycle
battery <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_cycle_battery>`__. But don't
hesitate to get your feet wet researching and designing a right-sized
solar nanogrid for your own community:

| http://wiki.laptop.org/go/XO_Solar
| http://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/power
| http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Battery_and_power
| http://schoolserver.wordpress.com/training/power-when-its-not-always-available/

Thanks for taking solar engineering seriously, as we do wherever
possible! (Engineers definitely subscribe to Richard Smith's `"power"
discussion list <http://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/power>`__ if you can.)

How do I provide Wi-Fi (wireless) to all my kids?
-------------------------------------------------

If you want a self-contained (single-unit) knowledge hotspot, consider
Wi-Fi capability physically inside your server (despite its limited
radio power?) If so, run "iw list" to determine if it is capable of
Access Point (AP) mode, enabled by
`hostapd <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostapd>`__. Of course you may
need to run "yum install iw" first, so the iw command is available on
your server.

If you want higher-powered Wi-Fi equipment and antenna(e) fully external
to the server itself, consider approaches from http://villagetelco.org
where possible, detailed below. More experimentally, `Anish
Mangal <https://github.com/m-anish>`__ has experimented successfully
with `cantenna(e) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantenna>`__ in India,
between classrooms and schools.

Within classrooms, many deployments use the $20 `TP-LINK
TL-WR841N <http://www.tp-link.com/en/products/details/cat-9_TL-WR841N.html>`__
as these Wi-Fi Routers have proved generally reliable over the years.

We recommend deployments *double the classroom capacity of these WR841
routers (to almost 40 simultaneous connections)* by trying Terry
Gillett's SECN-XSCE firmware here: (based on
`OpenWrt <https://openwrt.org/>`__, but far simpler)

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| http://download.villagetelco.org/firmware/secn/unstable/tp-link/SECN-4/XSCE/|
|                                                                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

April 2016's RC3 firmware release is increasingly stable: strongly
consider it or more recent. It should be followed shortly by a
stable/official release we hope. There is firmware for all recent
versions of WR841 hardware (v8, v9, v10 and v11) so be sure to select
the correct one.

When flashing a TP-LINK with original factory firmware, install using a
firmware file labelled "factory" from the RC1 or RC2 folders. Otherwise,
use a firmware file labelled "sysupgrade" to upgrade from one
OpenWrt-based version to another.

There is also a wiki page outlining how to use PoE (Power over Ethernet)
and how to daisy-chain multiple such routers together:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|http://wiki.villagetelco.org/Power_over_Ethernet_for_MP02_and_TP-Link_Routers|
|                                                                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Most important: take advantage of community support, where volunteers
are eager to help on the
`server-devel@lists.laptop.org <http://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/server-devel>`__
and
`xsce-devel@googlegroups.com <https://groups.google.com/group/xsce-devel>`__
mailing lists. There's always **tons** to learn from the latest Wi-Fi
fieldwork success stories.

Also consider IRC channel #schoolserver on http://webchat.freednode.net
for live chat, and
`unleashkids@googlegroups.com <https://groups.google.com/group/unleashkids>`__,
which is a great place to ask educators about various schools' filtering
recommendations, across different age groups and cultures, whether your
school is online or off!

Finally, don't hesitate to blog or write up your own specific
recommendations, no matter how large or small your school. This vital
engineering shop-talk upholds more schools, libraries and orphanages
than we can count (building our community repertoire of Wi-Fi wisdom,
often far from the Internet, creating "knowledge hotspots" in every
sense) in turn allowing kids to take advantage of amazing free Digital
Libraries like http://internet-in-a-box.org and Pathagar e-books.

How do I change the wireless network name?
------------------------------------------

The wireless network name is how people connect to your school server
when they are using a Wi-Fi device. This name is also known as an SSID.

How to change it depends on whether your wireless access point is
fully-external (such as a wireless router) or rather under direct OS
control (e.g. internal, or a tiny USB-connected wireless adapter) :

-  If it's fully-external, change its SSID (wireless name) using the
   documentation that came with the router.

-  If it's under direct OS control, then the school server is the
   wireless access point. Earlier, George Hunt's command "xs-hotspot-on
   " solved this on XO-1.5 and similar. Conversely "xs-hotspot-off" to
   turn the internal hotspot off entirely. You might also log into your
   server's Admin Console (http://box/admin) then change the SSID
   (wireless name) there, under Configure -> Internal WiFi AP ->
   Internal Wifi Access Point Name. This setting will not take effect
   until you click on Configure menu -> Install Configured Options (red
   button), and wait many minutes for all new settings to take effect
   (monitor status under Utilities menu -> Display Job Status).

WARNING: do not edit /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf directly, unless you want
these custom settings trashed upon updating IIAB! If you still insist on
editing this file despite the danger, consider "systemctl restart
hostapd.service" to avoid rebooting.

See: `What are the default
passwords? <#What_are_the_default_passwords?>`__

Can I name my server something other than http://BOX.LAN ?
----------------------------------------------------------

http://box.lan should work in ~99% of all cases, and http://box should
work in ~90% of cases; there is no need to change these.

If however a custom name is desired, this can be implemented within each
school/library/clinic by logging into Admin Console (http://box/admin)
-> Configure menu -> Network Parameters -> Host Name, if you click "Save
Configuration" then "Install Configured Options" (waiting patiently for
that to complete under Utilities menu -> Display Job Status; which takes
~25min on a Raspberry Pi 3!)

Many different names have been used in the past, such as
http://schoolserver.lan and http://school.lan -- anything that resolves
locally to http://172.18.96.1 should be sufficient with standard
networking. For the record, some of these older names are listed within
the following links:

| https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/roles/network/templates/named/school.external.zone.db
| https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/roles/network/templates/named/school.internal.zone.db
| https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/roles/network/templates/named/school.local.zone.db

Advanced implementers may want to change these 4 zone files too, all
within the very same /var/named-xs directory:

| school.internal.zone.16.in-addr.db
| school.internal.zone.32.in-addr.db
| school.internal.zone.48.in-addr.db
| school.internal.zone.in-addr.db

See: `What are the default
passwords? <#What_are_the_default_passwords?>`__

Any other networking tips?
--------------------------

See local\_vars.yml just below.

If you use a USB-to-Ethernet dongle (for upstream Internet, generally)
use a permanent marker on the server's correct USB port, so that it's
not accidentally moved to another USB port!

Also, do not swap the dongle for another, as each dongle has a
fixed/unique MAC address. Worst case if your dongle is lost or broken,
you will later (after the new dongle is inserted) need to rerun
"./runansible" from directory /opt/iiab/iiab when your Internet
connection is live.

A high-level networking summary is here:
https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Networking-Overview

More advanced networking insights will follow from the `stock
instructions for setting up upstream and downsteam
routers <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ez1H2LYrkqeXR_r5T93CMdmx9CeTJp_vC-IDBGam1Bc/edit#heading=h.rt7rcwigph2r>`__
attached to Intel NUC hardware, just as an example.

NOTE: Some prefer Gigabyte BRIX (a drop-in replacement Mini PC, instead
of the Intel NUC) as an Atheros internal Wi-Fi module can be inserted,
to scale beyond Intel's soldered-in limit of 12 Wi-Fi connections
maximum.

Classrooms within 100 meters of your school server can easily be
connected using standard Ethernet wiring, or using Wi-Fi repeaters.
Outdoor wiring is possible (preferably fiber optic cables below ground)
but check with experts to avoid problems with lightning. Beyond 100
meters, a more deliberate tree and branch solution may be needed.

Please ask questions about your specific school's networking/wiring
challenges at http://IIAB.io and on mailing list
`server-devel@lists.laptop.org <http://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/server-devel>`__
!

What is local\_vars.yml and how do I customize it?
--------------------------------------------------

Put variables within /opt/iiab/iiab/vars/**local\_vars.yml** for all
your Internet-in-a-Box installation(s), to override defaults, if use of
the Admin Console (http://box/admin) is not possible.

Do NOT modify default\_vars.yml, as explained in the `IIAB
Architecture <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Architecture#variable-precedence>`__
and `IIAB
Variables <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Variables>`__ docs.

An `example local\_vars.yml <../local_vars.yml>`__ is posted for
comparison. Also, a couple very practical networking variables are
posted at the bottom of the `IIAB
Networking <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Networking#common-customizations>`__
document.

Operators should place changes in local\_vars.yml using a text editor
such as vi, nano, or emacs. Remember to enact all variable changes by
running "cd /opt/iiab/iiab" followed by "./runansible" (takes ~20 min to
2.5 hours on Raspberry Pi 3).

*Or, the essential `1+6 "post-install"
roles <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/iiab-from-console.yml>`__
of Ansible's 9 overall roles can be run from Admin Console (log in to
http://box/admin) -> Configure menu -> Install Configured Options
button. Then monitor the progress (typically ~20 min on Raspberry Pi 3)
within Utilities menu -> Display Job Status. PRO TIP: monitor live
progress using "tail -f /tmp/job-"*

PRO TIP: if you've accidentally made changes that prevent "cd
/opt/iiab/iiab; git pull" from merging GitHub's repo cleanly onto your
local machine, consider backing up local\_vars.yml and starting
completely fresh. Starting fresh (after you've backed up everything as a
precaution) means removing all of /opt/iiab/iiab, recloning from GitHub,
and then restoring your local\_vars.yml into /opt/iiab/iiab/vars

See: `What are the default
passwords? <#What_are_the_default_passwords?>`__

Is a "Rapid Power Off" button possible for low-electricity environments?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Small medical clinics and electricity-starved remote libraries
typically require this, given that Raspberry Pi computers do not have a
physical Power Off button, and it is asking too much for non-technical
users to use the Admin Console.

Set "**allow\_apache\_sudo: True**" in
`local\_vars.yml <#What_is_local_vars.yml_and_how_do_I_customize_it.3F>`__
and then run "cd /opt/iiab/iiab; ./runansible" (runs for ~20min on
Raspberry Pi 3).

To power off, any user can then click on a URL like:
http://box/common/services/power_off.php

(Whereas schools do not want this, for obvious reasons — a mischievous
student could shut down the Internet-in-a-Box at any time! This is the
reason that "allow\_apache\_sudo: False" is the default.)

Known Issue in `IIAB 6.3 <IIAB/6.3>`__: You also need to run "cp
/opt/iiab/iiab/roles/httpd/files/html/services/power\_off.php
/library/www/html/common/services". This is done for you automatically
in pre-releases of `IIAB 6.4 <IIAB/6.4>`__.

| See: `What is local\_vars.yml and how do I customize
  it? <#What_is_local_vars.yml_and_how_do_I_customize_it.3F>`__

What security tips exist?
-------------------------

NOTE: Many `install images <http://tinyurl.com/iiabimages>`__ include
ssh keys which permit developers to log into your machine, to enable
remote support during Beta programs and similar. You can disable this
feature by running terminal command "rm -f
/home/iiab-admin/.ssh/authorized\_keys".

Whether running your server online or offline, please see
`../Security <../Security>`__ and help us contribute to this evolving
knowledge & repertoire of 21st century hygiene, thanks to professional
volunteers from many backgrounds.

Can my XO-based server boot with a unique startup sound?
--------------------------------------------------------

Yes, when using an XO as a server, it is easy to mistake it for a
child's laptop, when it has been detached from storage and networking
components.

Here are `instructions <XS_Community_Edition/Features/Startup_sound>`__
for adding a unique startup sound.

How do I get Internet-in-a-Box updates every few months or semester?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Great question: the magicians behind http://internet-in-a-box.org
anticipated this would be critical, despite the near-impossibility of
downloading large Content Packs to remote locations in the developing
world. Certainly, Internet-in-a-Box improved its Wikipedia
full-text-search in 2014/2015 (which remains compatible with XSCE 0.4,
5.x and IIAB/XSCE 6.x) and some remote upgrades are occasionally
possible.

And yet an honest calculation of terabyte download costs and
frustrations explains why drop-shipped hard drives' "content catalogs"
are more economic and efficient than overweight monolithic download
torrents.

On the high end, IIAB's Admin Console (http://box/admin -> Install
Content) supports piecewise incremental content updates for those
schools with extremely high/affordable bandwidth. As of early 2017, note
that Content Packs must be manually removed, when space is needed (e.g.
after that content is no longer in use). An exception is KA Lite, whose
administrative interface (log in as "Admin" to http://box:8008) supports
deletion of lessons/videos, as well as downloading new ones.

As a practical matter, remote schools may receive updates via hard drive
or USB memory stick every semester or so, flown/driven in by a partner,
bringing new maps/encyclopedias/E-books and video lessons.

Keep in touch as new options evolve! Make contact with
http://unleashkids.org if you want to order a copy of the `latest
Internet-in-a-Box
content <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RXzapvzvGRxPoJk0v9Wsdn0Wv02M-iokY6jZ8BQDh9U>`__
from these volunteers' community effort.

See: `What are the default
passwords? <#What_are_the_default_passwords?>`__

How do I know what version of IIAB I'm running?
-----------------------------------------------

Log into your school server's Admin Console (http://box/admin) and click
"About" in the top-right. Look at both fields "Version" and "Commit ID".

The "Version" field should show something like "release-6.3" or
something else if you're running an earlier pre-release from
https://github.com/iiab/iiab/commits (=
https://github.com/iiab/iiab/commits/master)

Compare the 40-character string "Commit ID" to "Latest commit" at
https://github.com/iiab/iiab/releases (e.g.
https://github.com/iiab/iiab/tree/release-6.3) to reconfirm you have
`IIAB 6.3 <IIAB/6.3>`__ (e.g. it should begin with **bf9c09a** if you're
running the official IIAB 6.3 from July 13, 2017.

Caution: The letter 'g' is sometimes added in front of 7-character
githash (abbreviated from 40-character as above) within "install image"
filenames, in places like http://download.iiab.io/6.2/rpi/ and
http://download.iiab.io/6.2/x86/

See: `What are the default
passwords? <#What_are_the_default_passwords?>`__

What technical documentation exists?
------------------------------------

`Core IIAB/XSCE 6.2
Docs <https://github.com/xsce/xsce/tree/release-6.2/docs>`__ were
migrated to https://github.com/xsce/xsce/wiki for IIAB/XSCE 6.2 in early
2017, and then to https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki in June 2017 (for
IIAB 6.3 and beyond!)

Implementers should start with April 2017's new **`Install
Doc <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation>`__**, focusing
on the **`"Take a Short
Cut" <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#take-a-short-cut>`__**
section!

Living Docs are ever-evolving for great reasons, as technical progress
is rapid, so you may want to bookmark our http://IIAB.io community
forums as well.

**Offline operators should check our growing collection of
Internet-in-a-Box technical support docs (and eventually videos!) being
made available at http://box/info.** Some operators prefer to download
the very latest tech support documentation every few months when their
server is briefly online, by running "cd /opt/iiab/iiab/scripts;
./refresh-wiki-docs.sh".
`1 <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/scripts/refresh-wiki-docs.sh>`__

The earlier `XSCE 5.1 + Internet-in-a-Box Install Doc for Intel
NUC <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ez1H2LYrkqeXR_r5T93CMdmx9CeTJp_vC-IDBGam1Bc>`__
from 2015 can sometimes be very useful for hardware implementers.

Also see George Hunt's foundational collection of XSCE (School Server
Community Edition) docs from 2012-2015 at
http://schoolserver.wordpress.com

Finally, `Anish Mangal <https://twitter.com/m_anish>`__ hopes to
formally write up his `deployment recommendations / 8-part training
materials <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2qGKOFYikSuT0dGRWZNWlVLUmM>`__
based on his experiences setting up IIAB/XSCE in `Northern
India <http://bhagmalpur.wordpress.com/>`__, while

human experience around Haiti/Mexico deployments and beyond.

Please suggest improvements to this FAQ where you can, and check back to

How can I remotely manage my Internet-in-a-Box?
-----------------------------------------------

Large-scale implementers should consider rolling their own
`OpenVPN <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVPN>`__ for all remote
administration needs, or paying a management service like
`remot3.it <https://www.remot3.it/>`__ (formerly known as
`Weaved <https://www.weaved.com/raspberry-pi-remote-connection/>`__).

Small-scale implementers may consider XSCENET, which is a minimal remote
management solution (with a much more basic remote console, enabling ssh
and http among a trusted group). Contact holt @ laptop.org for details.
If you are using XSCENET, the "iiab-remote-on" command is generally
equivalent to "systemctl enable openvpn@xscenet; systemctl start
openvpn@xscenet" and the "iiab-remote-off" command is generally
equivalent to "systemctl disable openvpn@xscenet; systemctl stop
openvpn@xscenet". If you do not yet have these commands, you can
implement them as aliases within /root/.bashrc

NOTE: Developers' ssh keys come included with `several install
images <http://tinyurl.com/iiabimages>`__, to enable remote support
during Beta programs and similar. Read "`What security tips
exist? <#What_security_tips_exist?>`__" if you want instructions to
remove these keys.

Those with a graphical environment (X Windows) on their
Internet-in-a-Box often take advantage of
`TeamViewer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeamViewer>`__ for full
visual/remote control. This can be priceless when mentoring/learning at
a distance, thanks to TeamViewer's screen-sharing, keyboard-sharing and
mouse-sharing. Simply `install
TeamViewer <https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/linux/>`__, which by
default randomizes TeamViewer's password (needed for remote access)
every time TeamViewer is launched, preserving local operator control.

You can also enable TeamViewer's fully "unattended access" by setting a
"permanent" password for remote access within: Settings/Extras/Options
-> Security -> Password.

**Raspberry Pi:** ''If you have the full Raspbian with Desktop (OS with
full graphical environment) on an RPi3, you want the minimal "TeamViewer
Host" (e.g.
https://download.teamviewer.com/download/linux/teamviewer-host_armhf.deb
was version 12.0.78433 Preview H as of June 2017). It works as a
single-click install (or "dpkg -i teamviewer-host\_armhf.deb; apt-get -f
install") and is more robust than the 2016 version (unattended access is
now far more reliable!) It also now includes seamless ongoing upgrades
via apt.

Bonus: headless installation/configuration is also now supported (e.g.
on Raspbian Lite) with "teamviewer info" "teamviewer passwd " and
"teamviewer help" per
https://community.teamviewer.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-to-install-TeamViewer-Host-for-Linux/ta-p/6318''
In future, it might even be possible to install directly with "apt
install teamviewer-host" ?

KA Lite Administration: What tips & tricks exist?
-------------------------------------------------

Khan Academy videos and exercises are extremely popular within KA Lite,
and the videos within /library/ka-lite (etc) can be structured in
different ways.

For starters, log into http://box:8008 as the Admin user, learn how to
install language packs and then download/delete videos in different
languages.

Run "/root/iiab-factory/content/khan/ka-scan" to remove obsolete videos,
which will be moved to /library/ka-videos/obsolete to help you free up
space!

Click "Scan content folder for videos" within
http://box:8008/updates/videos/ (when logged in as user Admin) if KA
Lite's DB gets out of sync from the video collection on your disk.

Multilingual? Consider running 2 or 3 instances of KA Lite on the same
Internet-in-a-Box server, e.g. we sometimes put `English on port 8008,
Spanish on port 8007, and French on port
8006 <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Networking#list-of-open-ports--services>`__.
Examine the
`mk-other-kalite <https://github.com/iiab/iiab-factory/blob/master/content/khan/mk-other-kalite>`__
script if you too want \*direct\* access to Spanish videos in
/library/ka-lite-es, \*direct\* access to French videos in
/library/ka-lite-fr, etc. If you do this, you may need to modify
`iian-gen-iptables <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/roles/network/templates/gateway/iiab-gen-iptables>`__
to `open ports below 8008 <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/88>`__,
if you want "campus-wide" (WAN) access to these materials.

See: `What are the default
passwords? <#What_are_the_default_passwords?>`__

What are the best places for community support?
-----------------------------------------------

Start with http://IIAB.io forums, `live chat on
irc <https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#schoolserver>`__, or post
to one of these 2 mailing lists:

-  https://groups.google.com/group/unleashkids   FOCUS:
   teachers/content/learning/libraries
-  http://lists.laptop.org/pipermail/server-devel/     FOCUS:
   technology/networking/upgrading

Describe your issue in full (with context) so that others may help —
including screenshots if possible, Thanks!

If you need live (irc) chat support from global volunteers, but have
intermittent Internet, consider an intermediary computer (`irc
bouncer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_(software)#IRC>`__). An irc
bouncer accumulates irc responses when you're offline. This enables you
to follow the flow of conversations that are ongoing 24x7, when you
return online. Finally, if you're a regular contributor to
Internet-in-a-Box, we can help arrange an irc bouncer for you. If so
please get in touch, and please see `Reno McKenzie's irc
instructions <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LofncyUS90gO8DFgDJZKLf2DPnEUlJe0MVoa5-i7L8A/edit>`__.

CONTACT: if need to get in touch regarding strategic alliances or
partnerships with Internet-in-a-Box, please email Adam Holt (holt @
laptop.org).

How did IIAB/XSCE's design evolve?
----------------------------------

Here's our brief-but-growing participatory design archive / lineage:

-  Our earliest work is based on `One Laptop Per Child's original XS
   design and implementation <School_Server>`__ which arose in `January
   2007 <http://wiki.laptop.org/index.php?title=School_server&oldid=23045>`__
   to be used in `many countries <http://olpcMAP.net>`__, thanks to John
   Watlington and Daniel Drake.
-  Jerry Vonau greatly cleaned up XS(CE) networking, from approximately
   2010 onwards, so that vital new hardware and networking topologies
   became possible.
-  After the XS Community Edition grassroots team came together during
   the middle of 2012, using the XSCE name selected by George Hunt,
   Sridhar Dhanapalan wrote the `Design
   Document <https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1dnhU2F6EntepVXTgN8QpkME8fZVUuPjcCoMUfAVKbcc>`__
   in September 2012.
-  Field implementer Tony Anderson expanded on these ideas laying out
   some `Use Cases <XS_Community_Edition/Use_Cases>`__ in October 2012,
   while many others contributed to a broadening roadmap of
   `features <XS_Community_Edition/Features>`__.
-  `Internet-in-a-Box <https://github.com/iiab/internet-in-a-box>`__
   (also built by volunteer professional, including Caltech and JPL
   software engineers) was founded separately by Braddock Gaskill in
   this same
   `mid-2012 <https://github.com/iiab/internet-in-a-box/commit/9c3a5ab5a7a19e9eb084cc0ddeac942d66dbaa69>`__
   timeframe, in Southern California.
-  David Farning's Activity Central team supported several developers to
   work on XSCE during the 2013 and 2014 timeframe, including Anish
   Mangal, Anna Schoolfield and others!
-  German Ruiz at Fundación Zamora Terán expanded support for XSCE in
   Nicaragua, Columbia, Dominican Republic and Honduras (etc), as the
   natural successor to OLPC's original XS.
-  The XSCE project embraced the Internet-in-a-Box name and IIAB's
   underlying OpenStreetMap work increasingly from 2013 onwards, until
   formally adopting the Internet-in-a-Box name (IIAB) in early 2017.
-  Beginning in 2014, the XSCE project greatly increased its content
   collaboration with Internet-in-a-Box (hence our new name), with
   Kiwix.org, and with RACHEL (Remote Area Hotspot for Educational and
   Learning) -- in each case greatly assisted by Tim Moody.

`Community history <../#Our_History_.26_Inspiration>`__ is vital to all
seeking to avoid reinventing mistakes of the past, thanks to Everyone's
thoughtful input past & present!
